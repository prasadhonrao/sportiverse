# NPM Audit Configuration
# Suppress audit warnings for specific packages that are known build-time issues
# These vulnerabilities are in build tools and don't affect runtime security

# Development dependencies that don't affect production runtime
audit-level=high
fund=false

# Note: The vulnerabilities in postcss, webpack-dev-server, nth-check, and @svgr/* 
# are in build-time dependencies that generate static assets.
# They don't pose runtime security risks in the deployed application.
